        My beverage of choice is teaÂ : I like Oolong black tea and chrysanthemum tea. <br>
        When twinings are not available and offered tea in a bag, I choose Earl Grey. <br>
        But when I go out for lunch with friends and colleagues, I usually get a beer. <br>
        My favorite beer is a blond lager called Druvel. It is imported from Belgium. <br>
        It has a good reputation worldwide although it not well known here in the States. <br>
